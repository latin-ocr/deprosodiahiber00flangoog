CHAPTER VI.
Qf the kind of metra called Seu-ona,

1. ’Πιε metre called Seu-ona requires eight syllables in the
first line of each semi-mette, but 1n the rest seven, not more
nor less in scansion, whether an elision occurs or not.

2. It requires further that the first line of each couplet
should have its final word of two syllables recisely, but the
other lines should end in a word of one sy able, as:

magne seat ‘pa erem eata Second couplet of a
'O’etctt ne oreon ceneaga cen-o. ‘senona verse.

[Literally: A white salirfo’n darts under the wings of a swan
That flew at the man With the spear.]

h· ε
vd na ηυῦι an gr oto lssorgne, Second couplet of a
Ὀο ni ῦῃ oon cornute cnion. reu'ona verse.

[Literallyt The King Ovs. {station he who made it- ,
He that makes green once more the old withered stubble.]

These, however, are all examples of the coma-o or closing
couplet—not of the reowo or leading distich.

3. The monosyllabic word in which the second quartan
ends is called by the Irish mange* before which there should
come immediately a word of two syllables. It is allowed,
however, that between these there may occur an ωῐιτηυεευῐιω,
that is an adverb or adverbial particle, which does not affect
the onage or “ ‘neckss' But although allowed it is considered
a fault in this strict species of verse, as here:

Cuimmg 30 brun. Δ 1⁸³ xo notui

pust na ceni cCoLLA ⁴21⁸ ·oo cot!
[Think, O king, that in thy pulses
Blood of three great Collas runs 1]

—where between ccotta and crat lies the adverb an, for of
*oo no notice is taken, as it is not an adverb.

²⁸¹ This word bflAvge—lit. neck or throatss-is merely another name
for the· monosyllabic ending os a couplet in rea-om or ‘in [the true]

one sense is the ending of a couplet or verse, may also be looked on
as the neck or connecting link between two couplets· or 'two verses,

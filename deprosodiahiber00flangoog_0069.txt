CHAPTER VII.
Os Great and Little Versification
also os Carbo-mn.

1. From the two kinds of metre already described we
must pass to the other three we have mentioned, in which
also in common with the first kind (neum-oe) there are four
quartans and seven syllables in each quartan-in which
latter particular as well as in some others, resona differS,
as we have said, from all others.

2. The metre called great versification* or nannongeaco
mon, besides the seven syllables in each line, requires also
that the last word of each line should be 'a monosyllable
or word of one syllable. Besides this, it is necessary that a
iffg‘i'ivssffissffi‘vissrfii'sswffifissffsse31201‘33 {223¹}f2201111223ffl232‘3
these should assonate or rime, but it is not necessary that
the final words oi the other lines should rime. It is demanded,
however, that there should be a correspondence or rime
between two other words in each couplet, of which one
is to bein the first line of the first couplet anda corresponding
one in the second line ; and of these the word in the first line
should be the last but one, or nearly 80, of that line, and should
agree with its riming word of the next in number of syllableS,
in quantity, in vowels, whether slender or broad, and in the
sound of the vowels, As to the rest, it is not necessary
that each word in the first line of the first semi-mette should
{rave perfect correspondence with each word in the second
1ne. <

¹⁸ There is some reason for thinking that in naming this metre there
has been an error which has been lightly passed on-that, in fact, this
(with the monosyllabic ending) is the true pannungeacc beas, and

” that with the dissyllabic ending is the true pannutgeact: τὴόμ. See

my senet SAvolmta gaeottge for a discussion of the point (Sealy,
Bryers and Walker, Dublin).

†This shows that as explained in Chapter IV. venene is really but
another name for comanos or assonance, only given rather to the
internal times than to the final ones, The riming of a final' with an
internal word in a succeeding lineis an amur, and sometimes this term
is given to the internal riming word itself.

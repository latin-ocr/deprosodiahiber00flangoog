must have thought highly oi the Grammatica-though here
and there he criticizes it ireely, sometimes undeservedly—
for he quotes it in his own Irish grammar no less than eighteen
times in the accidence and five times in the prosody—
occasionally to the extent of whole pages, but always in the
original Latin and never in translation-which, of course,
looks very learned and very imposing. Though Fr. 6 Molloy's
accidence is quoted so often by O'Donovan, and though it has
many points of interest to the Irish grammarian and to the
student of the Irish language, that part is not near so valuable
or so systematic as the Prosody; and the relative value of
these two subiects in the mind of the author seems to be
shown in the fact that whilst the whole of the former subiect
takes up but thirteen chapterS, the latter alone—as already
stated—comprises twelve, nearly a half of the book.

That the Prosody has never been translated before is no
doubt due to various causes—one being that the work is
extremely rare—I believe there are hardly three copies known
in all Ireland. Another, Ι suppose, is that though a knowledge
of Latin is common amongst the clergy and the learned
professions generally, few amongst these classes had any clear
knowledge or understanding of the technical terms of Irish
prosody ; and perhaps another reason is—nobody else thought
of doing it.

Now this is not a work on the nature of poetry, nor on the
beauties oi poetry, nor on the different kinds of poetry, nor
does it compare Irish poetry with that of other nations—
it is simply a technical treatise on I rish versification‚ as
practised in the middle ages and down to the seventeenth

century.

It is not a complete treatise on Irish Prosody3 it does
not begin early enough, nor with the earliest kinds of Irish
verse, nor does it come down late enough. Yet the author’s
Cap. XII. De Vulgari Versu (“ of Popular Poetry '')‚ though
short, is most interesting, and shows that he was familiar
with the later accented measureS‚ which, indeed, he treats
as if they were not at all late or recent. In this respect,
as in a few others, O’Donovan was not quite fair to our
author, for he not only omits all treatment of such poetry

CHAPTER IX.
Os the M θένε called opovgneac.

1. This kind of metre called opotgneac*—-in Latin s 'nasum
or the thorny—permits at the pleasure of the au or any

number of syllables in each line, from nine to thirteen. But
each line should end with a word of three syllables And

’ besides this, the final word of the first line of each couplet

should make a comanos or rime with some word in the
beginning or middle of the next line. There should be
uerene, too, or assonance of its own kind towards the end of
each second quartam and the other words also should agree
and assonate with each other, one in each line. Lastly,
the final words of each couplet should rime, as in the following t

'Oo gem nom San totta gon impensum, eto.

2. 1 will not omit another kind of verse—called car-namn
oeanncpom, or heavy-ended carosum, and no wonder, from
the length or weight of the ceann or end of each line ; it is
made, however, in the very same way as the car-namn
already described, except that each line m it now ends in a
word of four syllableS, the whole line containing eight, as
may be seen here:

‘mac rcro <m ‘ruocc monn-manannam, etc,

[Literallyz
Yon youth is of the race of fair Manannan—

That was the race active and vigorous—
But—O stout chief of the fine broad shoulderS,
By whom was made fair Manannan himself Ρ

¹⁸· This ὀᾸη ·o mgnesc was, no doubt, called in contrast to min niveae,
the latter the irect or straight metre, the former the thorn metre.
The word is derived from onotgeaemn or omageann, We draen,
Eng. thorn, and it was probably called thorwy from the irregular
length of the lineS, and from its alternate times—though, no doubt, also
it was a difficult or thorny metre to compose in. I have seen occasional
verses of wotgneac, but I am not aware of any lengthy poems composed
in it—though such may still exist.

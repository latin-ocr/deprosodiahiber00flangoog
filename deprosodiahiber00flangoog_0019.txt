CHAPTER Ι. [xiv].

1. Thus far we have in some fashion written as the gram·
marian : letterS‚ syllables, spelling, pronunciation, declensions
and conjugations we have touched upon, as well as the parts
of speech. It was my intention to prefix a treatise on Rhetoric
to the Prosody. For a ¹poet deserving of the laurel‚ making
measured speech out o unmeasured, com his verses
with much art, and with difficulty can he o without such
art* But time did not permit; by one thing or another
I was distracted‚ I was growing infirm with a body hastening
to decay. The Prosody alone, therefore, I will give here,
accompanied by the rules and observances of the ancients.

2. By Prosody I here mean a certain method or art of
constructing verses, But verse is speech duly restrained
by a more or less strict law of feet or syllables—the most
ornate mode of expression. Verse or mette, with the Irish,
is as commonly given threesold--namely -οᾹη oi eac (direct
metre)o1xu1tm5eacc, and ogmar, all of which will be treated
of below, But especially I must treat of that metro—van
ὀῆὲειὶῡ-ἆ-ὡῗ rsnaost ifflffiutlfi (zi all I haifre exgler sedon ᾗ heard,
an urs o aarenow oun uner esun;
which being onge well understood, no difficulty will be found
in understanding the rest.

¹⁸¹ The author implies that even a poet would be the better for a
knowledge of the art of rhetoric.

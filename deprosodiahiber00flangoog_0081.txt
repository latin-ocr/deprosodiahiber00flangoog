ὅ. In order that a verse may be in imitation of the greater
versification nothing is required but that the endin words
of the lines should be monosyllabic, as already state Nor
dooe it matter whether they are united (rimed internally)
in a broken and imperfect manner, or perfectly and fully:
it sufficeS, however, 1f an amur occurs in lace of a perfect
rime, but it requires that the lines shall en in monosyllableS,
and the word in the second line with which the final of the
first line is to have an amu or im rfect correspondence
should also be a monosyllab e: an this should lie in the
middle or near the middle ; and the final words of the two
couplets should rime, at least according to amur, as may be
seen in the following:

. ὈᾸ teis& '50 ruam-meac ῦὸ, ete.
[Gffithssffi' &²2¹2 {2332321323251 day,
Johnny Wall would leave the world
Outside h1s cottage--there to* stay 1]

or to take a more devout* theme:

Τωεξᾞῖἓ) Ῡὲξι( ῗῗιῡῶἷῖ εᾱέἒιὴωεέοῗῗὲᾈξῗ
Who'll reioice when my day 1s done—
ῼῖἕοιιΙᾶ I could hang the three straightway Ι)

e devil, the worm, and my son l

6. Just in the same way ogmcar is made to imitate the
lesser versification, observmg only that the final words are
now to be dissyllables, as here:

On 3111 *go 0¹:⁶¹2?ss 150 nonme, ete.

[ Ηεωζ υἶραίξίιῐιὲῃῐῗὲν ῗᾶῗίιὲίξῖι- .
Thy deft touch makes matchless music
Soothed my earS, my old eyes glisten l]

¹⁸· The wish e ressed in the second couplet can hardly be called
“ devout,'’ but . ό Molloy was thinking of the general nature of
the poem of which the above is the first stanza--a m on death,
of a moral or didactic nature, but with a strongl mar ed satiric vein.
It is ascribed to 'nonnemo 'mov onAtmg, Abbot ofrBoyle in the XIIIth
century, and is given in full at the end of this book.

2. Now· this concord or alliteration is twofold, namel
proper (or true) and improper or apparent, or as we call
them pion-uantum and umm guerre. That is called pion-emm
or true alliteration in which the two last (chief) words of
a quartan agree in the aforesaid manner. It is called unum
gnome—agreement to the eye—when the words of a quartan
alliterate, but are not the two last words. Of the true or
proper alliteration you have an example in each line of the
stanzaalalrezffiy given. Of the improper or apparent allitera-
tion t e t 'st

‘O’fnon cogare comantem rioteAm:
[By the man of war is fostered peace]

Here cogare and comantem« agree in their initials in the ,

manner already explained, but as they are not the two last
words of the line, the concordance or alliteration is the
apparent* or improper species.

3. Notice‚ however, that an adverb †‚ never makes or hinders
an alliteration. So also it neither makes an assonance (or
rime)—of which more below—nor hinders one, nor does it
ever constitute a mun or point, the greater or the less, nor
a union (internal rime), of which matters Ι shall treat hereafter.

* similitudinaria (apparent or seeming) is here not a very exact
term, for ὁοεωύ and cor'nmtceav make as true and real an aniteration
as any other two words beginning with the same consonant—the
aspiration of c (in &osan-o) not affecting the matter, as is explained
later. The only differ-enee ie, they ate not in the strong or emphatic
place—for as the second half of a verse was usually the stronger and

[The quicker the choice the better l]

'{2220335b1ssssk5q3323ynfflss’ssfiefflstssgff‘a'ffas&2521ssssss ξί. ἐὲοῖῖἶ
as I have sald, ls short, but the 1n1t1al of the next ls long,

there may or may not be an elision in that case, according
to the exigency of the verse, as may be seen in—

Ῥυᾼῐωῐ· boga ό Unum boroe—
[A bow Ι had from swarthy Brian]-—

where to keep at least seven syllables no elision is made from ν
the meeting of the A in boga and the preposition o, and the ·
elision is omitted lest there should be a syllable wanting.
Otherwise it would be better to have elision, although it may
be excused when it could be done onl ‚ as I have said,
by a certain licence. I have said it woul be better, because
in this case one of the vowels is short, and the other long ;
whence whenever both of the vowels are short no elision

occurs* as appears when we look at the a in pa and the ι of ·
mnsno in the following—-

Acatm pa unguo on eoccl
[I am in anguish from the death]—

* Here the author seems to contradict himself, for in a previous
example Ληωὺ με noga Δ ἀἱ finam—two short vowels meeting cause

an ehs1on. But though in such case bisini> or elision is usual it is
not of obligation.

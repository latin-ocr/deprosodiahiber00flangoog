. CHAPTER X.
Os the verse called by the I rish Dnmtmgeaec.

1. This kind of verse is made with assonance, at least of
the broken or imperfect kind spoken of above, also with
some alliteration and union, besides the points and endings
already described. The lines as before have seven syllables
each, and the metre is made in imitation of each of the direct
metres ; but oi them all, the most frequently imitated is that
called carbamn: aS,

mue eaotmg ag ctarmgeaec
ΡΛ bun anteum e’earecawm:
[Like a wild hog trespassing
Near thy foe’s fair dwelling-place 1]

But to me it seems that this example imitates rather the
verse called retrone mea-nonae, oi which above, where it may
be seen.* In another way, however, it may imitate the
lesser versification (nannmgeaec beag), as follows τ

ΑΕΔ Δ mn ‘o'toe’o η’ ὀἐιηθᾼὸ
trin emor ata consol

[Within that vesture simple
Beats heart of noble nature l]

2. And in the same way is made each of its couplets when
it imitates either the lesser versification or earoamn, and it
is named respectively from the kinds of metre imitated, as
ostaear itself is named ; and it will contain as many syllableS,
and oi the same kind, in each line, as the metre imitated
requires, all things being observed, each in its own way—
as the rimes, alliterations and unionS, as well as the final
assonance oi each semi-metre : as

‘mar ‘neom ραᾼῃαγ no etgean, etc,

[Whether of thy free will, or by force,
O fair queen of the pearly teeth—
Thou may’st bind me in silver chains
Or slay me with thy baton l]

⁴¹ The example, however, is not reu-ona τὴοᾼύόηᾼὸ but cernamu—
οι· rather its ogthear or bnmtmffiaeaet—for uuna v’neao. has eight
syllables and seven alternatel , e eight-sy bled line ending in a
ἓτὶεγῌεδξε, and the seven-syllaglffl in a dissyllable. (See Chapter on

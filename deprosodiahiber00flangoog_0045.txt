6. Ter-minatione or point& spoken of above, are divided
into the less and the greater—or, as they are called, the mnu
and the Amomnn. They are two words one of which exceeds
the other by a single syllable,· but let them agree—as has
been said before about assonance-in the nunpber of syllables
{fffisssstoffiefi‘fissts5331lkss‘iz ἓξ ἓῗὲἓὲΠέὴὲωἷῗέἐθῗΞῗὲχξὲἓὲξ
the first. The erfceeding or lon er point is called¹ the greater

syllables called the lesser, ,ιε the last word of the first 'quartan

for example star and rona , also cacan and cumeae-Aeo, also

savaro and wammam. f these, with the word star as ’

minor point the word ponar as major point well agrees, when
duly placed in a stanza--and so ot the rest.

7. I have said in whatever verse it is admitted, because, as
said above, although admitted in the metre called petowe,
b no means is it equally admitted into the five* others
agove enumerated. Let this serve as an example of this

mette:

’ Οςιὸᾱ *oo ὓῖ 45 mume mom
nae ctus enneae ’na tronom:

[Noble the servant of Mary,
Never refused he to honour her l]

Here mom is the minor point, and n-onom the major.

enumerated in Cap. 1., p. 4.

Do Prosodid Hiberniae. 81

4. S, the leader of all the consonants, does not admit an
equal nor even one like it-has neither kith nor kin, nor an
other letter with it in the same class, although it unites wi
any other consonant in the same syllable; and therefore
in vei-{ebietf makes no correspondence except with another r,
as sal ore.

[Correspondence here implies both assonance (tear tear,
mor, emor) and alliteration (as rust, rat, riou, reoL)].

5. Notice that m final in words rarely ends a long syllable,
unless in a very few which are marked as long as mam,
acam or cam ; nay, strong consonante in the end of words
ordinarily give the vowel a medium quantity in pronunciation
—medium‚ Ι say, that is between short and long, as Ι have
already pointed out.

When ὴ immediately follows p, then ’ρὴ sounds exactly
like thes of the Latins, and therefore in verse not only ‘p but
’ρὴ also makes an alliteration with p, as is to be seen in the
following metrical line: ⁷ Α

&omnim 'oute mo penem-o pem!
[I confess my sins to thee l]

6. Whenever n follows p in the beginning of a word with
which and some other there is to be an alliteration, the ς
is in nowise considered, nor the ὴ, but the subsequent letter
whether consonant or vowel, as such word can only accord
with another beginning with an aspirated p or with a vowel,
{sn I have said before, and as may be seen in the followin' g
> e:

'Cosam team Δ tuat eume!
Where on account of the ι in team and the ι in tuat there
is a perfect* alliteration, in spite of the aspirated γε so also
between ι in tunt and the ι in Lrpe in the following line:

casam team Δ tuae Lupe!
—as I have said elsewhere.

⁴¹ Rather the weak or imperfect alliteration—occurring, that ie, in
the earlier part of the line ς thatin the second eitample being a perfect
grsffizncgfi (8)ξὲ 0290} occurs in the last part of the line. See Chapter ΙΙΙ.

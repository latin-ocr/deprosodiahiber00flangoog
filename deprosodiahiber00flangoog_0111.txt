10. Again as to assonance3‚ let this be the first rule z

First: a vowel does not assonate perfectly except with
its like, i.e., the same vowel in another word, although any
gggnvpgirgl may accord, i.e., alliterate , with any other, as has

Secondly: Every consonant alliterates with its like [with
the same initial consonant in another word], yea, even may
rime with it, but if in riming words there occur more than
two consonante, it is not necessary that more than two of
these should correspond, as has been already said z so that
to correspond with the word Ὀ meet-spemn it is only necessary
that the other word should have a c and r in the middle
without any c or g or ῃ, although if they {could agree in all
Eesffilcttsfi-vghitch could rarely occur—the assonance would

e e e er.

Thirdly : Every consonant is allowed to rime in the manner
already stated, except sometimes the soft ones (c, p, c), of
which it is necessary to remember ‚what was said above,
as also about wordS, the powers of the letterS, eclipseS, elision—
50 that each consonant should have its own proper power
in the rimes according to its natural pronunciation. ῑ There-
fore catceati and micea-o well assonate, because although
two consonants c and c meet in the first word, still in pro-
nunciation they sound as a single soft‘ consonant.

Fourthly: Assonance requires words to agree in the
number, quantity and order of their syllableS, not so much,
however, nor with such rigour, that the consonants may
nod be transposed sometimeS, as may be seen in maenam
an rotcmp. Α

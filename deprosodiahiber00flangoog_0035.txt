Or, fifthly‚ it may finish with a genitive dependent on another
substantive, 35,

m coenom 005310 banna!
[Unequal the fighting in Banva 1]

gr, sixthly, an active verb aiter an accusative may end a
ne, as m, Ar 01133503 311 bean rom tonum-2
[F air is that woman I 111]“111·3.]

Or, seventhly‚ a substantive in the accusative to an active
verb may end the line, as in,

1Ίὶ veona 1300 1013331· 111113011
[Unmanly the soldier that inj ures a woman 1]

6. Neither eclipsis nor aspiration‚ nor the nudation* of a

consonant (t, ,11, 11) 11131 15, neither ammosa-oi· of which we ’

have spoken above, nor renmmgao nor tomo-o-——hinders an
alliteration, except in the two following cases:

(1) When the letter 11 immediately follows a p and causes
it to be pronounced like p, then also 1.· (or pn) must be the
11111131 oi the alliterating word, as may be seen here:

A’ommm ome mo ’0333310 pem.
[Ι confess my sins to thee ll

(2) Whenever 11 follows the consonant ρ in the beginning
of a word, that is, when an initial 1.· 15 aspirated, then it is
not this 1.· which is to make the alliteration, but the next
consonant (t or 11)-11 3 consonant follows—as in

Casum 133111 3 une 61 nel
[Prove to me, Ο ord of rne 1]

-where the t of 133111 and the t oi tuuc make an apparent
concord or alliteration. Also

ῐ353111 133111 3 pune Life-
[Prove to me, O lord of Liffey l]

—where the 1, in time and the t in 11113 make the proper
alliteration.

¹⁸¹ The author does not define nudatio or 10111311 in his Grammaticus
but 1 think he means the tightening of t, 11, γι 31 1113 beginning of words
when under the influence of aspirating particleS, 1110, oo, etc. In
tAffl 1113 t is 3110111 01· 3331111, in mo tArh the t is 3311110111 01· tom (light

or bare).

†u111·o¹uga·o (eclipsis) was sometimes considered a derivative of
’01015311 or moga-o cutting off, destruction, Ο. Ir. 1111130, but more
usnall it is written oft-ouban, 3 eompound of ’011030 darkemng, stom

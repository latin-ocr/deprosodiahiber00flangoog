De Prosodid H ibernicd. 31

So it ought to be in the second semi-metre in all cases 01
11115 measure—as can be seen in the following complete
stanza:
Thrice three hundred and three score—
Tale unheard by thee before—-
Feasted free in Calvach’s hall
Caring light what might befall 1*
Or thus:
Youth who never flinched from fight-
None could beat and none aflright—
Never bent the knee through 1031-
Poplar tall without compeer 1†

8. Union which we call umeness is an agreement 01 two

words much like what has been said 01 correspondence or ⁴

assonance, except that it does not require the same vowels
always—although it demands that this agreement should
be between slender and slender, and also between broad and
broad, 101· thus and not otherwise are words united or matched ;

as may be seen in caol, and maot, rangatca and 30303103,
3150 111 ³3¹5 and tas—but a broad syllable cannot be united

or matched with a slender, as ug and ως.

9. But 11 1110 words are not monosyllables but polysyllableS,
it will suffice if they agree in the slenderness or breadth 01
111011· 1351 syllableS, as soba and οπο-003, 3150 mtue and comme,
also ommate and reannotge. If, however, they agree in

all their syllableS, first and last, everywhere, in broad and
slender, or have onl all broad or all slender, the verse will

be all the better an the sweeter and the more graceful.

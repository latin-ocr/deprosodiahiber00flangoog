4. But the second serni-mette requires further that there
should be no (important word) verb or noun in the last
quartan—exce t the major point*-·-to which another in
the previous lline does not rime; for there should be no
word in the first quartan of this second semi-metre--whether
verb or noun—if we except the optanti or leading word and
the minor point—to which another does not correspond in
the second of the same. I have said noun or verb because
amongst such and similar words we do not count adverbs
or articleS, as I have said elsewhere. For example:

Osmc *oo ὒὶ as munte mom
nnc ctus eiceoo ’na ‘ri-onom,
[eir ηᾹῐι θ’Ᾱιι oon uste ban,
Annam Act: mame maen-11 !†

5. Here it is necessary, moreover, that the concords (or
alliterations) of the last semi-mette should be the true ones
and not the apparent. I will now show that this example
has all the requisites (of Irish nemine). You see, if you have
counted‚ that each quartan consists of seven syllables, not
more, as when scansion is made in the first line, elision occurs
between oi and ag: you see also the minor point (mom)
exceeded by the major point n-onom, and ¹with the same
quantity and the same kind of syllable, the „mn may be

contained in the amo-mnn—thus mom is comprehended in
n-onom. ’

* It is curious that the author for the moment does not seem to
consider that the mun rimes or “ corresponds '' with the Amo-mnn—
whereas this correspondence (in the accentad syllables) is one of the
chief characteristics of this mette. It is true, however, that whilst
μιηη and ‹im-o mn were used for the final rimeS, another name umbrie
was used for e internal rimeS, as b'lut and Δτὴὰιη, uite and mm e.

Elige, again, not the nature of the thing but the position makes t e
erence.

Never refused he to honour her—

Count all the fair race of women,
None loved he like unto Maryl

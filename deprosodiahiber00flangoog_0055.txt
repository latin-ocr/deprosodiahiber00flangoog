6. You see also how⁴ in the same line there is a concord
or alliteration—even the true one—between mm e and
mom, as they agree in their initial consonant. urther,
you see how the final consonant of the minor point
is similar to that of the maj or-——they are of the same
01355, namely light, and consist of the letter ῃ in both
cases, There is also to be seen in the second line of
the first semi-mette how there occurs a concord between
eiceac and ‘rt-onom, because they both begin with a vowel-—
for one does not consider the n, as it is not mdical, but
only accidental. Then, again, in the first line of the second
semi-mette there is a concord between b’Aatss and uite, for
they both have vowels for initials, nor does the b' in u'ast
hkilnder tliiis because it is an accident and not 3 radical part of
t e wor .

7. Again you see the minor point of the same line--namely
nan* comprehended—-so to speak—in the subse uent major,
which again agree in final consonantS, as n an ῃ are both
light and of the same class, F urther‚ you notice that An,
and amam have a union or rime 35 above explained ; another
also there is between mame and uite. Also you see that
the final consonants of the major and minor pointS, 222„ of

the words nan and matam are of the same 01355, namely,
both light. You therefore find in the verse all that is
demanded for this kind of metre.

²⁸ This curious word ban (oon unte ban) does not appear to be used
at resent, nor do I call to mind seeing it in this sense in any other
angor. It is not the word beon, though, no doubt, connected with
it, bean itself making ban in the genitive plural, and as a prefix
ban-onam, banfrtmt, 7c. Here it is a dative w1thout inflection of some
nominative ban which was a collective (prob. fem. with gen. bana)
like υᾼητμὸε, an emeat ban-oazwomankind, the female race. 'oon
unte ban=of all womankind.

†Notice τηὰἑᾼγε used here as a qualifying genitive ,· for the particular
phrase mame mistav we now mostly use mame fulicam or τἠὁὲωμ,
utting the second word in apposition to the first, here in the nominative.
Eut we have many phrases like mume mistav: cf. macaotii mne, cente
pm, mauzae pm, hamcveabac pm, ctgeafma earpms, ete.

De Prosodid H iberniae. 93

xiii. S placed before any oth ,r consonant makes the
preceding syllable short, unless it is naturally long, as marg,
omre, ete. But a short syllable becomes medium if a subse-
quent light consonant precede a rough one or r, as mancom

· mnnrto. So also a rough consonant coming before a light one

makes the preceding syllable short, as 311113, navemn, 313*

xiv. A syllable of medium quantity precedes no simple
or single consonant except m alone. But the reading of
authors and custom will teach thee such things as do not
occur to men living far off at Rome.

1229th add a few other rules for alliteration, and let them
ese :

i. Any vowel serves for a concord—or alliteration-—with
any other vowel—only they must be 1n1t1al and ‘radlcal
vlowelkslz of the words 111 which they occur, as Ι have irnphed
e sew ere.

11. If an initial ς 13 followed by n, then the alliteration
1Ῐί 1111Ξᾷ ‹sieterniined by the p but by whatever letter immediately

111511 alliterates only with another rh, nor does r accord
with rs or ro or rm, or ›ro—but only with another (pure) r.
The same is true of ηπ, rt, γη. ‘pn alliterates with another
pn, and also with p.

iv, When the initial of a word is eclipsed, then it is the
eclipsed letter, not the eclipsing one, which is to alliterate,
thus bean and m‘ouaemu, alliterate.

v. An adverb commonly called mvmoeanta neither makes
nor mars nor helps to make an alliteration, and if such be
added to another word, nevertheless the alliterating letter

will not be the initial of the adverb, but that of the other
word which it qualifieS, as was said before of mo and ·00.

⁸¹ It is curious that much as the author has said about the letter r
and its powerS, nowhere does he notice the distinction between the
broad sound in 1¹31, and the slender in reotz μὴ* 1111133 with banr
and reon alliterates with roan. Many circumstances seem to point
out that the slender sound (sh in English) is not ancient but com-
paratively modern—though, no doubt, the two sounds existed in Fr.
ό Molloy’s time. This sh sound does not appear to have existed
in Latin or Greek, though modern Italian re resents it by sci or sce.
The Russian has a separate character for ‘s sh sound borrowed,
1 believe, from the Hebrew. French represents it by oh, German by
sch, the Spaniards also seem to be develo ing it, for 1 have heard
{3¹¹3ss {ssssffiziffiep‘ffigunnnffi ῗὲἕῗῗιὲἔῖἰθ ζῗῑῗὲθὲεἰῶἳὲῒ {siff-423·
In words like tension, excursiogn where the English {ive then the sound
of sb, the French still give 1113 original hard s sound.

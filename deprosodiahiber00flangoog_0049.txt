De Prosodid H ibernicd. 33

10. Ending‚ or ceann* as it is called, is a monosyllabic
word which a semi-mette of the kind called reaona requires
in the last place of the second or latter quartan, of which kind
are torm and omonn at the end of the following semi-metres:

Orgne Cataom monn Δ ormo, ete.
Cahir's heir, his people’s chieftain,
Loved by us and worthy all—-
Holds the flag of Erin fearless

Leader peerlesS, praise not small l

11. uptam [spearshaft]† is the name given to the first
word of any semi-metre—-not being an unaccented mono-
syllable—-and it is not necessary that it should make a rime
or have a word riming to it, neither is it a fault if it makes
any such rime ; whence if a word of this kind does not occur
(that is, if a semi-mette begin with an unaccented mono-

> syllable) the semi-mette is all the more to be praised, and

such a teatmnn (or half-verse) is called by the Irish mm-
·oeunam which signifies perfect composition—“ perfect '⁹ being
understood in a limited and figurative sense. [In the resona
verse above given ozgpe is the αῃωηη in the first semi-metre
and is without a rime: in the second opacae is the uptam

and rimes with eatae in the next lineJ. ·

12. Another thing required in some kinds of verse is called
the amur, and this demands that the vowels should be of the
same sound, and almost coincides with the imperfect asson-
ance or rime, of which I have spoken already ; except that
the amur always and indispensably demands equality in the
number of syllableS, as here:

If bounty be theme fo'r hard ,
Η valour regard should win—

Such traits in the son of my king
I could sing whilst the world should spinl

²⁸¹ This term ceann is sometimes (as by O’Donovan and* others)
rendered head, and it is ossible that 6 Molloy may have understood
it in that sense: but the tin caput and its French representative chef
also mean end, and the Irish ceam· very often means end as in ceann

4. Ι have said of two syllables at least, for sometimes the
first feet of the lines consist of three syllables, and in double
verses the second and third feet usually consist of three
syllables at least, if not more. Further, both to simple and
double verses some for greater elegance or for some other
reason, are accustomed to add two more feet of uniform
length to each line, so that these two feet—the one being
a dissyllable, the other of one or more syllables—neither
rime with each other, nor with any other foot of the line
to which they are added, but make a good assonance with
similar feet in the remaining lines—so that each foot (of
these additional feet) may be even a dissyllable. This
addition they call rtet (ιη-οπως mattmg (“ a yard to the old
lay ’³ ?) : as would be done it to the first line of the above
Irish verses were added abur no cau„ to the second ap mro

5. The other kind (of popular verse) ⁴known as the eamne
is usually composed as a naenia or dirge for the death of
some ῙΡθτῗοῃ, although it may bedlmade of αῃὲὼει· οὲῃετεοὲθῐ,
name , or a man s ralse or s ralse. ve e o a
caomeyusually consistsp of only foul? feet, each orfywhich will
ordinarily be a dissyllable, nor does the first foot require
’ to rime with any other, nor the second and third except with
each other as to sound and syllables 3 and the last foot should
rime* with the last feet of all the subsequent verses, as:

Ruencac neeman naccam„ eaccae,
enom eneaeae capae cea-ocae!
O'Ruarc the nobfef] '1nighty‚ gloriouS,
O’er troops of foes 1n fight vxctonousl

⁸ Itis to be noted that though the author in this chapter on Popular
Poetry says much of correspondentia (assonance or rime) he says not
one word of concordia, tle.. emm or alliteration. ’Πιο fact ιε, the
more assonance was cultivated the less the initial harmony or aniteration
was regarded ; and whilst this umm or alliteration was an essential
in a line of Irish verse in olm niveae, in the folk verse on the other hand
it was only an ornament. Some of the popular poets used it very
sparingl , others used it largely. But from the earliest times emm
or ini harmony was a characteristic of Irish style both in prose and
verse: one of Fr. 6 Molloy's own examples of the vulgaris versus-
nemeae ίμὲτὶωμ, eta—shows almost as much observance of allitera-
tion as ο assonance.

De Prosodid H ibernicd. 63

Recalling to mind what we have said of nemroe you will
see all things occur here, not in the exactitude of that metre,
but in appearance, which sufficeS, for indeed it suffices that
there should be the minor and major pointS, that an alliteration
should occur in each of the lineS, either the perfect or the
imperfect, and that there should be an amur or internal
rime, and that the major point should contain the minor—
although the former may exceed the latter by more than one
syllable, as here:

bono Δ εῃθΔὺΔη <m sao evang
matt mac eacac muigmeaoam—
[Proudly his foot treads every shore——

The foot of Niall, son of Eochaidh Π*

Here you see, contrary to the laws and rules of direct matre
and of cenot-oe, the word evang, a monosyllable doubtless
and the minor point—contained, so to speak, in the final
muigmeaoam as major point, but it is exceeded by more
than one syllable since the former is to be counted and is a
monosyllable; and in nemroe it is a fault, but not in the
imitation of nemi-oe, when amur supplies the place of a true
assonance.

4. Another ogmoar imitates renum, of which we have
spoken before, in which amur ‘has a place, and also opaga-o
(or the “ neck ''); indeed, if amur be made with a word of
two syllableS, so much the better; but with or without
this, it still remains imitative, as:

Sao Δ Sne 'ri-agam cn'mgmo

tonan, pattomg, 'tneo ‘mont l
[Wear them, Sheela, though ill-suiting—
Vest and mantle, satin braid l]

[This js. not pure reujomx, because (1) the concords agai-o and
§31:12 ffassemssffitdffiewvaesssslffi&ssawata Σῖἕξῗέ
are not perfect assonances but imperfect. The couplet is
therefore ogmcar of reuona, ια, mutated or imperfect
{gagosstunnlffiit 1n syllables and 1n the terminations 1t resembles

¹⁸· Or, ibly, “ Fierce his wave (beate) on every shore-The, stron

wave o Niall, ' etc„ for cpeacan has at least two meanings, whicfi
probably Sint to two different words: (1) εμεᾼὲᾼη, the foot, allied
to the Iri tpotg, ephee, Welsh troad, whence a parently the English
treads and (2) cveaean, the sea, a sea-wave, alli to the Greek Triton,
a sea—god. In the latter sense emat is the usual form, eveniam being
the genitive: it is to be noticed that at any rate the word above has
a short eo, for eneae is the macne or internal rime corresponding.

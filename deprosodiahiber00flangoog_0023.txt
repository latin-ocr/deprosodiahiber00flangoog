CHAPTER 11.
Os Quartam· and SyllableS. ’

1. A metrieal verse taken as a whole—commonly called
a nn, or pann tomum—is made up of two semi-metres or
h f-verses, In verse that much of a metre is called a quartan
which, consistin of several words united, contains a definite
number of sylla les. 1t is called a quartan because it is a
quarter or fourth part of the whole verse (or stanza), whilst
it is one part of the two forming a semi-metre. A poem,
which we commonly call nan, consists of many verses
(or stanzas), as many as the author may wish ; it is by some
called a numm* A semi-mette is called a tenenann or half-
verse, and when of two semi-metres a full verse is made,
the first is called by the Irish reotan or the ‘⁴ leading,’' the

second coma-o or the ‘⁴ closing.”

2. Whatever the number of verses in a poem, they should
in themselves make and include a complete sense without
depending on any other poem or division of a poem. Nay,
even the first semi-mette of a verse should make a complete
sense, independently of the second; nevertheleSS, when, as
above stated, a verse is made of two partS, the ma be related
to each other, and their sense be mutually ref‘erre to the one
proposition. In composing verses, however, it is well some-
times to begin with the second semi-mette (Ι) i.e., with the
coma-m so that the first semi-metre may be made with
full sense and strength, and match the second one the more
worthily and the more gracefully ; for the coma-o or second
half is far more difficult than the first, as shall appear below

¹⁸¹ But 'ouon (or mmm) originally was a special mette—indeed it was
but another name fot pannungeact bea , whilst vannungeact: ήιόμ
was called the ‘pop-'onan or greater onan. n course of time the word
came to be used for a poem ιιι general, especially a poem of distinction,
thus mun πιόῐνὸᾼ was used for an epia poem. Hence nuntiosve, a book
or collection of poemS.

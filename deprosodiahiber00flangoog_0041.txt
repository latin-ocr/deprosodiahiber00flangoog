CHAPTER 1v.
Os Assonance and os Terminabions.

1. Assonance or rime—which we call commea—is two-
·‘fold, the one rtan, that is, whole or perfect, the other empne,
that ie, broken or imperfect. The perfect assonance consists
in the agreement of two words in the number of their syllableS,*
in the quantity of the voweIS, and in their union with similar
consonants either of the same class», or having them in the
order of their syllables; except that an initial consonant
need not necessarily correspond with the initial of another
word ; unless the initia] consonante -of more than two words
are compared; then, indeed, it is equal which of them corres-
ponds to another in another word, because it will suffice

if the Subsequent consonante—those following the vowels— ’

correspond with each other.

2. Hence as to the three soft consonante, c, p, τ, they will
correspond to any subsequent letter of the kind, and such
correspondence will be perfect ; thus noc, rep, tot, correspond
or assonam, for they are monosyllables of the same quantity,
{remeet &mmmm ποῖος.-
for ῃ and ι, are of the same k1nd], and therefore as the final
consonants are all soft, the words assonate or correspond in

every respect.

* This agreement in the number of syllables is only needed in certain
kinds of mette—as in monnavo, and the two varieties of vannmgeaec ;
obviously not in nettwoe where the riming words must have an unaqual
number of syllables, Still even in ventu-oe we must remember that
the accented and riming syllables must be of the same quantity and
equal in number—one syllable to one, two to tw0, etc.

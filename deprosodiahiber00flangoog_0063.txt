Three soii-dds e’er heard in his 10111555-

6. Again, this first line finishes with the word numo, that
is, a dissyllable‚ and so this quartan has in itself all the
conditions necessary for the first half of the first couplet.
Now let 115 go to the second line, which reads thus :

'Osanwo Δινο Δ 11-1011511 00111113

——in which you see seven syllableS, the last being now a
monosyllabic word Ξ there is also a concofid οἵ) 1311111311 ἑμίεἰιᾳέεὲψ

7. Let us now pass to the first line of the second couplet,
which is 35 follows:

53111 na ree-o Δ 1104111, na noetgteap.

Here observe that there are eight syllableS, and only ei ht·—
the 1351 word being again a dissyllable, an alliteration {eing
found between 110311, and noeigfrea not on account of the
11 found in each, which is 1101 radi in 5111151· word and only
adventitiouS, but on account of the 11111131 ·o which is funda-
mental in both words, In the next place, alliteration in
this line is observed between the last word and another near
it, which is alwa necessary, 35 15 3150 1115 0355 111 1115 1351

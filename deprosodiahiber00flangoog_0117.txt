De Prosodid H ibernicd. 101

3. Ι have said at least—(with regard to the two syllables
of the second and third feet)—-because some verses of this
kind are simple, of which I have just spoken, but there are
others called nabatea or double by the Irish, where the feet
admit of more syllables at the will of the poet. And trul
they have their own difficultieS, but they are not in much
esteem unless they have elegance and grace and thought—
unless they are pregnant with sense, such as may be seen
in the following specimen composed by a certain writer on
separating from his former Achates ε ·

Δ omnnem vigae ⁸05 generoeean rto, etc.*

· O fair)-r and loving letter, speed thou on to Banbhal
Tell them my sad message—-if they can believe thee—
Tho' my foes have blinded me beyond all knowing,
Only now at last have my two eyes gone to Erin,

How pregnant the sense of such popular verse may be
when duly composed you may guess from the following
Latin version made almost literally from the Irish :

Lingua nocet multiS, nam caecutisse Maronem, etc.

Llsshfflsdngue injures many, for speaking made Maro blind,
Ovid, too, suffered for speech, and I could name many

* This exam le of a song metre by the author himself is not the
measure deseri ed by him above—it 1s one of four feet (not five), the
last foot being monosyllabis, the first three trisyllabic and of an “ amphi-
brach ’⁹ nature. Keating, O’Rahilly, MacDonnell and others wrote
songs in this style and mette. Moore imitated the mette in ‘⁴ Let
Erin remember the days of old ''—-at least in the odd lines⁸ It is
curious that the author in turning his song into Latin does not use a
tyrio measure, as one might expect, but the elegiae. He was thinking,

haps, of its mournful nature and subject rather than of its form.
ἕο whole of the Latin poem is given at p. 111.

There are but two types of Irish song noticed here—or, rather, there
is one type described and another illustrated. But modern Irish
songs exhibit great variety of style and mette, and a thorough study
of these metres and styles would be most interesting and valuable
to all lovers of our native music, poetry, and literature generally.

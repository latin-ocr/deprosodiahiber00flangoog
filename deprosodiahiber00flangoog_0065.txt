8. Let us now go to the last line of this second couplet,
which is as. follows:

Sam ceo ιγ gam gennem„ ngonm l

in which you see but seven syllableS, the last, moreover‚ a
monosyllable riming thoroughly in sound and quantity and
even in its final light* consonant with the monosyllabic final
of the first couplet—namely eonm. For what greater agree-
ment or assonance could there be than that found between

Ἴ conm ancl ngonm, short of absolute identity ? †

9. You see aISO, as is required, there is an alliteration*
not the apparent but the real—between the final word nsovm
and that preceding it, gement. For they begin with the
consonant s as a proper and radical letter in each, since the
n is not proper but adventitious in the last word. Besides
this you observe there is an uerene or internal correspondence,
as we showed in Chapter XVI. is necessary, between noan.
in the first line of the second couplet and gam in the second
line of the same, as well 'as an amur between “meist-een

the leves or light, b, τ’), g, τὴ, t, n, ῃ. See Gram. Lat. Hib. p. 160.

rather variety of consonante», these latter, however (as explarned by
the author in Chapter IV.) to be of the same class, This, indeed, is
the real difference between the Irish corrumpe or assonance, and the
English so·called ‘⁸ perfect '' rime. The delicate-eamd Celt was not
satisfied with mere identity of vowels and consonants—which to

him would be monotonous, but sought rather variety in the consonants
that followed the vowel&

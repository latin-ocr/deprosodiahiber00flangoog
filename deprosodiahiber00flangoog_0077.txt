Os the verse called oswear'.

l. We have already spoken sufficiently of nan niveae or
direct verse—that now mostly in use—yet there remam some
other kinds of metre, inferior to that and not direct, of which
one is ogmar. This metre, or quasi-metre, or verse having
a show of metre, can be made ιιι imitation of any of the
direct metres above described, although it is more frequently
made in imitation of those called nemi-oe, reu-om, nannmgeaec

eat and small, and sometimes of cat-namn, as iar as the

t couplet is concerned‚ but as to the second, in imitation
of the minor versification.

2. Every quartan of it requires seven syllables, never more,
unless made as a· sort of reu-ona, when the first line of each

assonances it admlts and requlreS, that is, m order that they
may appeal to the ear, and it may have amur in place of the
true assonances. This will become clear⁴ by examples.

¹⁸· It is clear from the explanation and the example that ὀδιὶιόᾼφ
is not really a different kind of metre, as monnau-0, neum-oe, ren-om...
differ-ing in syllables and times-but an inferior or inexact variety
of any other metre, so that each of these has its ὀ mear. The name
is derived from ὀςιὸὸ, a servant, hence sometimes anslated “ service-
metre '’ and less correctl “ servile-metre.” Originally, no doubt, it
was the work of an ostae, a young hand, an apprentice, a learner,
not that of an σιωπὴ or master.

6. Lastly, the kind of metre called caromnn*-in which
again each line has seven syllables—should finish each quartan
with a word 01 three syllables, and requireS, like the rest,
its alliterations, assonances, and unions in due proportion ;
nor is it less 31115116, though it may appear less agreeable,
as may be seen in the following:

‘punit mog Aemo Ῐῗτοηηιοεᾼ, 616.
ιῄθὸῐῖᾘέ 01 kings were the fields 01 Fionnlugh,
Cahal's hill stood near their gates—-
But struck with the weapon 01 Iughaine's grandson,
That weapon slew the keeper 01 1116 11111.

——where you see the 11065, 311 01 1116111 seven-syllabled, finish
in a word 01 three syllables, alliteration occurring iri the
first quartan between acm-o and 1310001033, 35 they begin

11111131; 10 1116 531116 way in the second couplet anm and
11133106 accord in having initial vowels. Also there is
assonance between numm in the first line 01 1116 5660οᾶ
couplet, and mano in the last; and there is another rime
between gom and rom. In the last line rom and rioouige
alliterate in their initial consonant r: thus 01 011161 things, each
in its place, as has been said ν01 great versification. In addition,
examine the following verse written in the same mette:

tec-‚alvach og—-great the warrior—-
On field 01 danger—falls like thunderbolt—
Ever from hope 01 happiness

Sternly he cuts off 1115 enemy!

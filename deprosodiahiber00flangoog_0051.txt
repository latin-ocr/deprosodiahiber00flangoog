13. Some in making an amur put an a to rime with e
but rarely ; nor do Ι commend these, nor think they should
be imitated, because these vowels do not rightly harmonizc*
one being slender, the other broad—in fact, they make
rather a dissonancc. 01 in a short syllable makes an amur
with ω also short, as in cnon: and ptam, which rime because
the broad vowel in each is modified b a slender, and in fact
οι short soundls as m. For this kin of amur an assonance
can well stan .

CHAPTER V. .
Os the Metro called by the I rish nemi-oe.

1. A couplet of this kind requires that its first line should
end in a word which is the minor point or termination called
mnu. But the second line of the same couplet must end
in a word which is called the major point or ‹xm-ommi.

2. Any line of either teatmnn (or couplet) requires seven
syllableS, neither more nor . fewer in scansion—whether, as
has been sa1d before, the ehsion of any vowel occurs or not.

3. The first semi-metre of this kind—the leading or ηοω-ο·-
besides the minor and major point, and the due number
of syllableS, requires further in each line that concord or
alliteration I have spoken of above—either the true s cies
or the apparent, so that in each line of the first coup et at
least the weak alliteration should occur, but the proper or
true species would be more elegant; but the true always
without any licence is required in both lines of the second
semi-mette, that is, between the last word in the line and
another immediately preceding, or almost immediately and
very near.

¹¹¹ Harmonize: the author’s consonant is a very appr riate word
here for assonate, agree in sounds ,· this agreement or armony of
sounds is, indeed, called consonantia as often as assonantia by
continental writers on the subject.

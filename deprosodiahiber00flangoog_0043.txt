3. Thus San and Lag correspond or assonate on account
of the identity of the vowels and of their quantity, and of
the class of consonants to which Ὀ and 5 belong. similarly
correspond *oeaomono (tithes) and teanum-o (spread thou)
and temporo (he will follow) because they agree in· the number
of their syllableS, in their vowels and consonante, and also
in the final ὀ (which is the first in its class—the leves or
, light, ·o, b, g, t, n, μ, τὴ) as well as in the other consonants
c, c, p. In the same way, in all respects rime nam« and
saun and bau, and am and ban5; also eaor„ Aoi), Laog,
eaom, raon accord* or rime ; and so rime oaot„ paon, monst—
no notice being taken of the initial consonante.

4. Notice that some consonante change their power and
nature by their union with others (i.e., by eclipsis aspiration,
etc.)-about which more will be said later.

5. The broken or imperfect rime is the agreement of two
words in the number of their syllables, in the identity and
quantity of their voweIS, without reference to the consonante
as to s ecieS, genuS, or class—so long as they are not of the
class tssat form a perfect rime or correspondence. This
broken rime moreover allows that one of the words so agreeing
may end in a vowel, and the other in a consonant ; thus not
only do ear and tract, ntaonrg and oaonr form an imperfect
comannis or rime, but also ba and bar, 401 and amr.

* The author's concordant is, of course, here used in the general sense
of “ agree‚'’ “ rime ''—and not in the specific technical sense in which
he used it in the previous chapter—that of alliterate, make an alliteration.

>†caom 'm the more exact metros would not rime perfectly with
ὀΔοι οι· paon, for the ‘m is a strong or heav consonant riming with
tt, nn, ng, and not with 1, and n which are bo li ht : a better exam le
would be naon or caon—for t, n, 1¹ when mediaff' or final are all lig t.

But in the less exact ostaear metres, the riming of paon and mom
would be tolerated.

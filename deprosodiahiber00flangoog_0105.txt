De prosodia Hiberum. 89*

ix. A final r with another in an added syllable, as in gur-ru,
avails-—even with this double r—to rime with another word
having but a single r, as barn. So also a hard and a rough
consonant when sostened will correspond, as ῑοω and {ot-oa.
Similarly two light consonants serve to rime with one light,
as is clear from aaron) and summm, in the former of which
is found ’ὑ which is a single light consonant, while in the
latter we have tn two light consonant& Whence this couplet
is correct t

'Oot ummo ni ouo ‘oion 'omn
An summu) pios ΔΓ nioscm l
[To leave ye thus would mean much wrong,
To leave such throng of kings and queens l]

In like manner when the affix -ὈΛ comes aiter ι or n it
ἓῗὲἒρὲἓέ &affiffleit‘assfffigaffinssffissnteffsfiffwfffffss’y ’Σῗὲἐ
1n the greater and lesser point ; hence to the minor pouit
amm the word rao voa will make a good major. Tms

may ὶέεε said, too, o the same ending aiter other light con-
sonan .

x, When two vowels meet together in two se atate syllables
so that they do not constitute one but two sy ables, the first
will be short, if ever it was short by nature. Of a syllable,
however, with one diphthong or triphthong in it, as regards
quantity all these diphthon s ao, ιω, eu, and ω, and all the
triphthongs aot, um, un, ⁶ be long, without being marked
by the rtgne peon, or long accent. So also Ae is usually
long, except in a few words in which it is joined as a persona]
or verbal ending—what the Irish call a curum e—as in
sonae, in which and similar words it is consider short*

⁴¹ Ι have not met this gome, but it appears to be an old subjunctive
form—the second singular of the present tense—for sone (cf. bene,
came, eto.) and is probabl due to teuton Le ιοΔὲΔη-(ί.σ., sonae for
sone). So the ending osy the past participle -τΔ, -ca is sometimes
goritgen -tgt, ang icae, both of whic were probably short (cartae,
ep ne, m ae, e c.=.

Some call this not morinen-o but cmonnamoff another
like it, but of fewer s llables, is called oanan-o, whilst one of
more syllables is c ed eucnemon-o: there is also one of
which each couplet consists of ten syllables, five in one line
and five in another, as in the following, which was said, if
I mistake not, οἷ’Δοὺ mac nvom-

[i.e., Taller grows the grass
Not regarding Hugh l]

—which means ‘³ not having to obey Hugh, the grass is all
the taller '¹1 in which you see how elegantly is preserved

the due nmnber of syllables in the lineS, besides the alliteration,
assonance, and union already spoken of.

6. Other kinds of metre still are sometimes given—varieties
of the direct meti-es or imitations of them, but as they are
rare and not now in use, and as I have not met them, I will
not speak of them here. From those¹ shown here, however,
others will be easily recognised‚ both the metres themselves
‘and their laws, and therefore ior these I refer you, Ο reader‚
to the authors and to the precepts oi the old books,

¹⁸¹ This brief description of monzun-o is very far from satisfactory—for, such
a well-defined, ancient and important metre should have had a chapter to itself
instead of coming in aa aa astet-thought in a chapter on npongneac with which
it has no relationship at all. The definition given, however, is correct so far
as it goes, and the example chosen is a good one. The worthy father does not
seem to have known the meaning of the term μιοηηᾼπο, nor the meaning of
ὀΔηΔμ-ῑ) οι· οιέμθηηᾼμυ, though· he seems to recognize vaguely that the two
latter had some reference to number& tle„ to the number of syllables- which
ia not the case. We need not wonder greatly at the author (who lived out of
Ireland so long, and so sar away stom books and documenta) not fully realising
the meaning of these old technical terma, when some os the greatest (at least
most pretentious) scholare of recent times are still in doubt as to the meaning
of some of them. It is certain Whitley Stokes in 1862, when he publiahed
the Glossary to the Feilire (Three I rish Glossaries), did not know what an
imo waS. That‚ of course, is a long time ago, but eighteen years later when
he published his first edition of the Feiliro Aonghusa (1880) he was still in
doubt, sor he aska if an [lp-o was not an alliteraiion Ι The late Dr. Atkinaon,
who attempted to eoi-rect Stokea (and did on nome points), made aome
blundera of hia own on the same subject.

second couplet. [Translata-J ⁸ · .

De Prosodid H ibernioa. 77

Or take the following as an example of the npuiungeacc of
mnnuigeacc mon ε

‘ni tuit ran stop tit-aomo n-mc, etc.

[In the pleasant outward s ‘ g
Nought is there unless truth's told—-
Pleasant form and soul all sinfuL
Leaden blade in sheath of gold 1]

Imitation of the greater versification is also made in this
manner:
C ag an υΔιι, on ramas an ὈΔτι, ete.
[Sa the fate, oh sad the fate,
Sad man's state where'er he wends-
True it is men have no home
Where'er they roam, except with friends 1]

3. Or thus, with five syllables in each of the lines:
ῦὸ ar cum mo cumve, etc,

Long have I journey'd
For· two hours of day—
Should I go further

The dearer I'll payl

4„ In the same manner carnaim* is imitated b finishing
the quai-tans in ttisyllableS‚ other things being o ed as
above ⁶ pana auaro na nungentum, ete.

[Literallyz ·
How long the girls are coming

Who went to fetch m harp Ι

Kept not by length o the way
, But by their gabble in the garden Ι]

'ibus by keeping due proportion as we have already implied
one can imitate the form oi the others of which I do not give
exampleS, because to him who has read and observed what
I have said thus far, they will become at once manifest.†

⁴¹ This last example, however, ia rather renone ὼεᾼύόηᾼὲ, with its alternate
eight and seven syllables, than seven-syllabled urbemn. See the beginning
of this Chapter, par. 1.

†From this Chapter on hpustingeocc we gather that it is not a special
metre, like „tonnano or 'uerbi-oe or retrone—but that, like όξιᾶὁᾼγ, it is
rather a free and inexact imitation of other metues, and how it differs from
όξιᾶὁᾼγ is not very clear. The name b urtinseaec (like. carbatnn,

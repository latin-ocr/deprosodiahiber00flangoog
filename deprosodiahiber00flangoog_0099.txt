De Prosodia Η ibernicd. 83

7. For an alliteration of this kind with the consonant r
there is indispensably required another initial r in another
word, nor does f· alliterate with r but with another aspirated
r, nor does rt accord with anything but rt, nor γη but with
γη, nor 1⁶1* but with W*- If, however, it happens that an
initial r is preceded y the article an, as an cruit, and is
silent, then there is required in another word another r
(similarly eclipsed)‚ otherwise the metre will be violated.

Some consonants when joined to others in syllables change
their nature and pronunciation, as we will presently show.

8. Ι give here some further rules for assonance :

i. For assonance it is not allowed to use a simple consonant
unless there corresponds to it another at least of its kind,

either the same consonant or another of the same class so

that a light may conoepond to a light, a rough to a rough‚
and so of others.

ii. When an assonance is made, it is not necessary that it
should be observed between more than two of the consonants
found in the middle of a word, even if one of these should
be strong, and the other light ; so that rognum and sopmgun
rime correctly and sufficiently.† . -

⁴¹ No doubt this was the best and most pertect alliteration where
ammtessfffi ffiffsss‘ssbfflfflss} 22⁵5?ssss Qffieffssl'eafifiss’ 3²33
with r followed by a liquid—rt, γη, rte—but never wi rc or γρ, or
rt. Thus O’Huidhrin frequently has hnes like—

“Cmatt tan Ὀοᾼμδᾼ na meat) reon ’³
and ’Ὀ beaune co stasne rom? etc.

Ἰ· Probably when the consonants in the middle of pogium were
more strongly ronounced‚ this wor was considered a sufficient rime
to gonmgtan z ut for the last two hundred years these words would
not be considered good fimes, For in gottmgtan there are four internal
consonants still pronounced everywhere-even the aspirated ‚ though
this not so strongly: but in po ⁶ man the g is generally silent together,
whilst in Munster both g an τὴ are mostly silent, and the word is
pronounced ρό-Δμ, almost as a monosyllable—-but with a slight trace

of the nasal ῆι.

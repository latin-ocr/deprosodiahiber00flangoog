De Prosodid H iberniae 41

8. Or as here follows:
’(315 ἰω ὀθᾼειωῃ uam otte,
1315 ’na eutsean eunome,
Cis ’na nir, τις ’na bunne,
'Cis <mir ’na Romame!

ue„

Here's the rogue with others three-—
Next the knave with four you'll see,
Now again he'll come with one,

Or as Rury quite alone !
Or like this:

Stame- no cao tu man emat,
unge Δ εεῐιᾸῡε no Cinnam*
Subditce gan devm Δῃ cut
Cnen pe nubaitce Δ 'benetia l

ae„
Nobler than all as a chief,†
Tyrell great beyond belief-—
Strong 'gainst wrong thy noble mind,
Worth that never fell behind 1

f. Thus, also, you will find every other poem of this metre.

9. Difficult to write, indeed, appears this kind of verse,
but more difficult still to believe is the fact mentioned above
in the example given at p. 30 (“ Thrice three hundred and
three score '’). But it is perfectly true, and of the fact I have
myself seen and heard witnesses most worthy of belief:
namely, that under the rule of Queen Elizabeth‚ whilst the
kingdom of Ireland was in many places devastated with
famine, fire, and sword, and in dire straits owing to the
scarcity of provisione, Calvach‚ son of Conall, prince of the
6 Molloys, grandfather of the most illustrious present chief,
having invited to his house nine hundred and sixty persons of
all ranks for the feast of Christmas, freely entertained thern
there for the space of twelve days.

²⁸ The effluat mentioned here is, no doubt, Father Patrick Tyrell,
ex-diffinitor of the Franciscan Order, and one of the censors to whom
Fr. ό Molloy's Grammatica was submitted. He was probably a
native of Meath—at least of the diocese—like the author himself.
Τὴθ rest of this poem, which the author gave as an illustration of
*oenotria is given at the end os this book. {The name cmmt is also
spelt emtam.. and emam: cf. beatum an 1:1¹1&ng or beatae an
cwattmg=ryrews Pass in Westmeath.]

†As a chief, zze„ aa guardian or superior.

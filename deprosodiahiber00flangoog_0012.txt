the beautiful and artistic old Irish measures· First‚ that
we may the better understand and appreciate our native
Irish poetry, for in this, as in other asts, it is only those who
have some technical knowledge that can rightly estimate
its various points of excellence ; secondly, that we may learn
something of medieval Irish pronunciation—a matter that
many know little or nothing of; thirdly-following from
the second reason-that we may read Irish poetry with more
correctness and more expression; fourthly‚ that we may be
able to detect and correct the errors of careless or ignorant
scribam and lastly, that we may ·more thoroughly and
exactly understand even the meaning of our old and medieval
poetry. To many persons—especially the matter-of-fact and
“ scientific ’' who study poetry not for aesthetic reasonS, but
for the historica] or other facts it may convey, this will
appeal as the most important reason of all. Modern scholars
have shown that men even so great as O’Curry, O'Donovan,
Hennessy—nay, great continente] savants also, have often

The detached verses and half-verses which the author
gives to illustrate the Irish metres—removbd as they are
from their context—are in many cases difficult to translate.
My treatment of these odd verses is to myself—and will be,
Ι daresay, to my readers also—the least satisfactory part of
my work. Some of them probably are old traditional
examples often used by poets and grammarians in the schools,
and going back, perhapS, to medieval times—some of them
may be as old as the Book of Ballymote (XIVth Century).
A few are from the writings of known poets as 'nonnemo mon
ὁ 'Omma Coos ‘oAtt ὁ n-uigmn, grotta-opisve ὁ n-eoguraex,
etc„ whilst a good few others are from compositions of Fr. ὁ
Molloy himself, and these are generally easy enough.
Occasionally he gives a Latin version of the Irish exampleS,
but for the most part he leaves them untranslated.
O’Donovan, in his short chapter on Irish prosody, generally
gives ὀ Molloy’s examples but leaves thern untranslated. ’
No doubt, the prosody of such verses is independent of any
translation, though a reader is better satisfied when he finds

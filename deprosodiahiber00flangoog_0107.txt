xi. The diphthong eo is nearly always long except in a few
words of which neoc, neoc are examples. The diphthong
eu is always either short or medium, except in the curomrgn e*
or verbal ending of the second person singular of the imperfect
[and the conditional] as when Ι say ὀᾸ ηπυαᾼιιεθᾼ [or *oo
ouattpea] where it is long. But it is naturally short, unless
it is found long among the other diphthongs and triphthongS.
Other diphthongs are sometimes short, sometimes long, and
occasionally medium; so they have no fixed rule, but are
regulated by use and authority. When a (monosyllabic)
word ends in a strong consonant, it will be of medium quantity
by its own nature; still, as Ι have said, poets can make it
long as the necessity ariseS. But when strong consonants
of this kind come between two vowels in the same word,
as in comne, Lomge, butue, mnne, eamne, mne, rmge, etc„
the syllables sound rather light and short. If, however, a
soft consonant follows a strong one of this sort in the end
of a word, the 'syllable will then be of medium length, as in
rpongc, ete.

xii. A light consonant coming before a soft one, or a soft
one coming before a light one, makes the previous syllable
short, unless it is of itself naturally long, as in Aac, mone,
maenaa-0. But a hard consonant placed before or even after
a light one makes the preceding syllable of medium length,
2⁵ ffassi’<}{‚⁴{1⁷Z{32{t1fft·j {2355ssgoffllg‘gglfssekgbffgfflgffigssgg

the syllable short, as in mgna, Agna-unless it should be
long by nature.

*The term mrgne found in cuno-suffitae is variously spelt and is
used in various senses—-thus we find mrce, murce, mrem, mrcne,
and all these written again (in later times) with 5 (nurse, eto).
It meant (1) speech in general, as panna turce=partes orationi& parts
of speech; (2) in particular a pronoun, e.g., Fr. ό Molloy's mrsme
featbungte— ssesswe ronoun (as mo, ·00, etc.); (3) generally
now for ge r, being e grammatical term used to correspond to
the natural term emeat=sexz as ‘pm-mrce (pean-turcejzmasculine
gender, bonu-turce--feminine gender.

Τὴε root of mrce is probably mnnr=telL say, or thaps an older
form mamre containing a form mre connected with e Welsh dysg-u,

to teach, Lat. diso-o, Ι leam: Grk. ὂι-ὅάσκ-αλοςεεε, teacher. The

η found in last syllable (mrem, turone) may be a trace of an old verbal

effi (pf. mure murm, tu¹5re tuvgrm, or may onlybe a diminutive
p c e.

De prosodia H ibernicd. 51

10. The metre itself, though difficult, is very elegant, for
which reason I give the annexed composition,* explained also

in Latin, though not with such force, nor with the same
strength or savour:

A owe na mua-o Δ ‘ptum ptuncecc, ete.
1.e.,

Ο Fairest flower of the Plunkets

Worthy of honour and love-—
Thine thro' the prayer of St. Brigit
Be ages of glory above Ι

* The rest of this Irish poem is given at the end of this book—see
p. 109. It was addressed apparently to the oung Earl of Fingall,
then in Rome, probabl for his education. The lessed Oliver Plunket,
Archbishop of Armag , who was ut to death for the saith in London
in 1681—on1y four years after r. ό Molloy's little work appeared
in Rome—was a member of this noble family.

The Irish verse given above is a very good example of the metre
called reontio. The first and third lines have eight syllables each,
the others seven each. Δ ‘ptum ptuncett shows alliteration in the

first line, gtomhmp, ‘att m the second, bvmgfmm mag-oe in the
third, tuate, &att m e last. The first and third end in a dissyllable,
the second and fourth in a monosyllable3 31111508 has its amur in
mite, δῃωζτῆᾼμ and cmm-o theu· ameno (or mt times)respect1vely
in btmgaem and cotue. The English version given above is not meant
to show all the points of the Irish verse—giving but the ideas in the

most general way and in some sort of metrical form.

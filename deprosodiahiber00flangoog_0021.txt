De prosodia Hiberniae. 5

3. In order to have this ldnd of verse—called by the Irish
min vineae, direct mette, or pann niveae, direct verse—
seven conditions or requisites are necessary: (1) the due
number oi quartana; (2) a fixed number of syllables (in
each quartan) ; (3) concord or alliteration ; (4) correspondeat,
im, assonance or rime; (5) point or termination ; (6) anion,
and (7) ending ,⁴ which with us are called respectiveiy numm
eeacnonmm cmceacc rnotuu, amm, eomuwoaeo, „mn (agur
Διποῇτηη), aniene, asur cem. To these may be added
an elghthmnot that it is always necessary, but that it is
frequently adnntted--commonly known aa anunm (ehaft or
handle) of which we will speak in its own place.

4. The chief kinds of metre (to omit the less important,
such as those commonly called comt-mro& or powroe, of
which there are many varieties)-—the most important and
those now most in use with the Irish are five, and are called
neme, renum, flamnigeuct: beas, nonnmgeaet ‘cnon and
car-eamn.

ὅ. Notice, however, that of the seven necessary requisites
above enumerated, the four first are indispensably required
in every metre oi whatever kind it may be—-namely, the
due number of quartam, the ri ht number of syllables,
alliteration and assonance—-in Iri the ηαιιῄηι ‹teutpert-mn,
nutrium Ῡιοῑωύ m sao ceotnorham, umm and ecmannus).
But it is not so of the three last requisites there mentioned,
for they are necessary not for every metre, but only for some.
Thus the eater and less point (or termination) i.e.‚ mun,
are certai y and indispensably required in the metre called
nemme, unione or anion however only for mnnmgeaec mon
and caroamn, whilst ceann or ending is needed only in pannut-
geooc beas and rea-ona.

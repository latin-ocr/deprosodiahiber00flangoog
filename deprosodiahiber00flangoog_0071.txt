3. Let this be an example :

[Literallyz

Ill comes upon ill—a thorn tears open Theigue’s wound,
At untimely hours come blows of ill fortune—
After the havoc of the flesh tearing thorns
Comes the payment of the bungling ignorant quack l]

—Here you see all things observed which I said were

otmar. Again we find omnm-o making a perfect assonance
with η-Δπεῃὰεοιῡ, there is also a correspondence between
οεμγ and coeco, though not so perfect ,⁶ moreover, coec and
cuns excellently alliterate in the second line, where lest
there should be a superfluous syllable the Δ of coeca is elided
before the succeeding A of an. Also ωας and humo are
well matched (or rimed) as to vowels, syllables, sound and
quantity3 whilst the word enen et, the first that is in the
second couplet both is the uptam (or shaft) of that line and
receives that very name—concerning which see above.

like manner teon-ogast and oeogonmo are excellently
matched. You see here the rfect art of the great versi-

fication—in 'itself truly most ⁰ cult, as may be seen further
in the following:

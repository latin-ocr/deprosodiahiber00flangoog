TRANSLATOR’s PREFAGE.

 

IN the year 1677 the Rev. Father Francis 6 Molloy (rnomrmr
o mactmuaro), a Franciscan friar, then an exile at Rome,
published in that city a small work in l2mo. with the title
Grammatica Latino-Hibernica. This, Ι believe, was the first
Irish grammar ever printed, and consisted of twenty-five
chapters, thirteen of which were on the Accidence of the
language, and the last twelve on Irish Prosody. It is thaee
twelve chapters which are reprinted in the following pages
with my translation.

The previous year—1676—he had published also at Rome
a religious work in Irish with a Latin title—Lucerna F idolium
—(Loc1mnn na generomeac, or Lamp of the Faithful), a volume
still occasionally met with and certainly not so rare as the
Grammatica.

These are the only works of our author that appear to
have come down to our times ; but Anderson, in his H istorical
Sketches os the N ative I rish (Third Edition, London, 1846),
states that Father 6 Molloy was also author of an 8vo volume,
Sacra Theologia, published at Rome in 1667. And in the
Irish dedication of the Lucerna, addressed to Cardinal Palatius
AlteriuS, the author makes distinct reference to earlier works
which he had written, and for which he had received help
and patronage from the same exalted ecclesiastic Some
of these may still be in existence and may yet be brought
before the Irish public. The author seems to have been a
man of some consequence and position at the time in Rome,
for on the death of the great Father Luke Wadding in 1657,

Fr. ὀ Molloy was chosen to succeed him as rector of the Irish -

College of St. Isidore. He was already old (as he tells us
himself) when he wrote his Irish grammar, but he may have
lived a few years longer, and his period may be roughly set

down as from 1616 to 1686.

The grammar has, I believe, never been translated, though
often referred to and quoted: for instance, O'Donovan

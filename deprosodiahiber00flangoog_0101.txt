De Prosodid H ibernicd. 85

ιιι. It is not allowed in one of a riming pair of words that
there should be a superfluous r, or one to which there is none
corresponding in the following word ; whence ‘there is a fault
in the following verse in which ccatrgrm and „sverm do not
well assonate. Let the poet therefore be condemned who
sang badly as follows ε

nin tot oon cotrgrm mx enge, etc.
[On that {y he burned no houses—
But he’ll burn when next he'll war—
Creatures without goods or cattle
Shunning battle fled afar ι]

—Where true assonance between cCAwgrm and „sverm is
spoiled‚ and indeed that also between coirgrm and toirgmo.

iv. In order to make an assonance‚ a soft consonant c, ρ,
οι· c, admits a union with any other, hard, strong, or light,
in one of the riming words and these are to agree with
another soft consonant and some other joined to it, except
p ε so there is a right correspondence between resecatam and
teanum, also between semenare and reancflm.

v, When a rough consonant, namely c or e (or f:)* or ’ρ
οι· f· follows immediately a hght one—o, ὑ, , m, t, n, 11-
it will then sound as a soft consonant, tle„ ' e a c, e, p,
or tf· respective-lg? as {Z to ξιξ seen in ruccott, which sounds
asi 1 werewn enr cco

[Not a good example, for the aspirated c doae not here
follow a light but a soft consonant c, and rue-com„ would
not now be pronounced with a pure c, but rue-coti„ and in
Munster with a slight vowel sound between the syllables
rut: (A) cott- Compare seen (A) -ροο, rmn (e) -bean, an ἑξ)
-τὴωε, etc„ a pronunciation which seems to int to e
forilmffi Jexistence of a connecting vowel tween the
sy a es .

¹*The aspirated (ph or ᾗ) is certainly not a ‘⁴ rough '' consonant
like e, ὲ, οι· ῥ-ιιι fact, it is the pure r (being a strong aspirate) which
is the “ rough ’¹ consonant t the author himself has elsewhere shown
that f in prosod is treated as 15·›.‘l*he aspirated r was silent not
onl ιιι Fr. 6 Mo oy's time but or many hundreds of years before—
an the point over the p was really the punctum delens. In ancient
Irish the p appears to have been pronounced like modern Irish b or
English v ,· we find 041¹ and μμ, natta and retu, and in the future
p is a development of b : thus mot-pan comes from Ο. Ir. mot-ab or

mot-nb.

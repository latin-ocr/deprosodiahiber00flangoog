himself, but leaves the student to 111101 that Fr. ὁ Molloy
had not treated 01 11. Νο111101 is the original work a well-
ordered one, or logically arranged ; many things are repeated,
many other things that one might expect are altogether
omitted.

But with all its defects it is a most interesting relic 01 the
past—nay, Dr. Hyde, in his Literary H istory os I reland (p. 572),
does not hesitate to speak 01 11 111 unqualified terms as “ the
fullest, most competent, and most interesting account which
we have 01 1110 Irish classica] metres as practised in the later
schooIS, by one who was fully acquainted both with them
and their methods.''

Ι give the text as well as the translation, as scholars, no ⁷
doubt, will be curious to see the original Latin—especially
as the work itself is so scarce. But as it is no part 01 my
duty to correct the author’s Latin-f-even where such might
seem possible or easy—I give the author's text exactly as
Ι find it in the original Roman edition, with the bare correction

well-known contractionS. Nor am I called upon to criticize
his style. No doubt, the student fresh 110111 his Cicero or
his Livy will find a great difference in the Latin 01 Father

But though in the course 01 his treatise we may come across
what looks like an occasional native idiom—such as we find
111 1110 scholastic Latin 01 other nations—there is no doubt
the author had a good grip 01 1110 Latin tongue, 101 1101 only
is he able to discuss a technical subject in prose, but in poetry
also he shows himself competent not merely to write the

plopular medieval riming Latin verseS, but also good classical
e eglacs

And now if it be asked what is the good in these days 01
knowing, or even 01 troubling about medieval Irish versifi-
cation, Ι will reply that—even apart 110111 its value to
writers who may still love to practise ‘the old metreS, and
two or three 01 our living poets have successfully shown
that these metres are not so dead or so obsolete as was thought
. -apart 110111 this consideration, I say, there are many valuable
reasons 101 3 111010 general and more accurate knowledge 01

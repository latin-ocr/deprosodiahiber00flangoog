82. We have seen elsewhere (see p. 52 of the Grammatica)
that the susti·- consonante are three in number, namely, c, ρ, r: ;
that there are also three hard, namely g, o, -ο ; that three
sounds are mekoned rough, cn, en, pn (or p) ; that five sounds
or combinatione are called strong, ιι, rm, m«, m, ng; and'

that seven sounds are light, o, ¹0, g, m, ι, n, ῃ. The poetS, ’

moreover, teach concerning each of these classes that, keeping
the above order, those of the first class are ‘⁸ nobler '' or of
greater power than those of any of the subse uent classes.
And they say also that the consonant r „is the c ief or queen
of all the consonante, but that after this, the three soit con-
sonants e, ρ, c, excel all others in the succeeding classes.
Similarly they say the hard ones o, Ὀ, 5, excel the rough
(cn, cn, pn), and the strong ones the light—these last being
the lowest and weakest of all.

† Dr. O'Donovan and other modern Irish grammarians——without
understanding or trying to understand the point of view—have criticized
and condemned the old native classification of the consonante as
unsoiemifio — especially with regard to the names soft and hard.
O'Donovan and others say c, ρ, t are not ‘⁴ soft,” but ‘⁴ hard‚” and
that 5, b, ὀ are the “ sost” consonant& 1 believe these moderns
are wrong, and that our, old authors were right, according to what
wey intended to convey ι c, ρ, r: are mutes, non-sonant or “ silent ’'
consonante-therefore our ancestors called them bo , soit-sounding
or silent consonante, b, ¹0, 3 are sonant, audible, long, and therefore
they are emam-o, voiced or lond (hard) sounds: hog and emmo

De Prosodid H ibernicd. 105

Sometimes, however, the intermediate feet pass into tri-
syllable5‚ as in—- ·

ηΊόιηεεΔὸ, mammeae, Aoutnneac, etgneac—
and so of the rest*

6. LicentiousneSS, impurity, murderS, vile calumnieS, scur-
rility, lying, the fomenting of quarrels and discord5‚ are faults
not of the Art of Poetry, but of its perverted use—let me
say, abuse. Against those who thus abuse it, this loud
condemnation was once heard from Saint Jerome speaking
from his cave at Bethlehem (on the fifth chapter of Amos) :
We should not be led away by the sables os ῥοαῖς, or by their
ridiculous and monstrous lies in which they do not hesitate
to desame heaven itself, glorifying and raising to the stars even
the grossest depravity. Such poets as these deserve, so to
speak, to be cut off entirely from the sacred mount Parnassus
by Minerva armed with spear and shield.

7. Many pious compositions of Irish poets give pleasure,
such as that of Giolla Brighde (Ο h-Eoghusa ?) On C ontempt
os the World‚ those of Donnchadh ὁ Dalaigh, surnamed the
Great, on the Praises os God, and On the ever I mmaculate
Virgin M other of God ,· besides devout poems of other Irish-
men like those found in the writings of the Holy Doctors—-
as that of St. Bernard on the PasS1on of Christ, that of the
Seraphic Doctor [St. Bonaventure] who wrote the poem
called Philomena †--and others like them. Amongst these
the following composition finds place, written dialogue-wise,
for the innocent amusement of youth, and here faithfully
translated (from the Irish) t

⁵ ¹⁸¹ ’Πιθ treatment here given to ele-{nac poetry is very brief ; but though

there are many elegies written in e metre above described, -for which

reason it may be called an elegiae mette, there is hardly one that may ·

be called the ele iao metre of Irish verse—for elegieS, ancient and
modern, are found! written in all kinds of different metres—as a reference
to any collection of Irish poetry will show.

† Fr. ό Molloy uses the older form Philomela (the nightingale), but
the actual word used by St. Bonaventure is Philemona, a medieval
corruption of the classical word. ΤΙιο author used it also in a figurative
sense, meaning a deveat soul. The poem occurs in the sixth vol. of
the Saint's Opera Omnia, Moguntiae MDCVIII. [This reference has
been kindly cleared up for me by a well—known and learned Irish
Franciscan, Fr. A. D„ O.F.M.]

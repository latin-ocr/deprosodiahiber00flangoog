.De -Prosodid ..Hiberniam ‘57

Or this:
'00 016600 mo cam SA cun

Ceacc 50 canam ceacc 50 cmo—-

'mar 611 5Ῑ1Ᾰὺ e 51οη 5αῑ10’ eso,

nan <m pean <me 61111101

[Literallyt

A friend of mine on invitation
Used to act on the motto—“ Come alone, come for long ''
But whether he meant it for friendship or not-—
I' d rather the guest of yesterday stayed not to-day l]

5. Now as regards the other kind of metre called 116111101-
56600 0665, observe well that it is formed 111 almost the very
same manner as the preceding annm 56660 mon, except that
all the lines in it finish in a gell
the following:

Roga 116 ctomne Conntt,
ῑο56 na ’01101656 vennam,
'Cots mxv reeta-o 11115 nomam
conam. cus ⁸0 'eogan pennam!

ime

ssyllable, as may be seen in

[Literally· .
Choice of the elan is conau-
Best of the tribe I declare—
A chief for our guidance who went forward—
Conall who gave Eoghan his kingdom l]

-in which you see all things observed which are found in
the preceding metre, and no difference occurring between
them, except that the final words of 'the 111165 111 this metre
are d'issyllables*—-whereas the finals in the former case are
monosyllables. Τ116 following also will therefore be of this
1116116·ο

On mac 1100 coroa ’o’f-’mcm-o, 70.
[Lite1·ally:¹ e ⁴
From Fiacha' s eldest son
Little the good that falls on each worthy‚

But young Calvach 15 the choice of all chieftains—
Best of patriots, with the true stamp of 1115 racel]

* And ending in dissyllables--the long 61· or greatero oints-it must
be the true nannuageaet 111611, 66(1 not the other, which ould obviously
be called the mnnutgeact ὓ665.

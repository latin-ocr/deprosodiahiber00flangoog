De Prosodid H ibernicd. 107

Tityrus .· Let us go forth walking
Talking as we wander,
And embracing kindly.
Seek the wild wood yonderl
Prune thy vine's stray branches
And ’twill grow less meagre,
To rest at times from labour
Toilers must be eager !

N. Go thy way to pleasure,
Ι must go to labour,
Go——thou wilt repent it,
Play like idle neighbour 1
Ι shall ever weep thee
Voice in blame upraising,
I still love to studyfl*
Ever God's works praising 1*

[At the end of the author's Somno go· mor og agur esca
01 tem na naoth—given here at page 112—he finishes the whole
work, Gramman Prosody and PoemS, in a few wordS, of which
the following is a translation] ε

And now what I have said here of these trifles must suffice
for the present. But if in anything I have here failed, or
gone too far, I pray Ι may be excused--having lived forty

ears and more amongst strangers far removed from native
land, from native books and recordS‚ and from masters who
oould otherwise help me to clear away every obscurity.

&Blessed be the name of the Lord!

given here, and ,Ι must refer readers, therefore, to the original worlx.

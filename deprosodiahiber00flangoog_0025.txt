Do prosodia Hibernia. · 9

3. The number of syllables, called cernar* (mette or

measure) or emes-acc rtotwo (definite complement of syllables)
is seven in each attan (cesenam or line) not more, except
when one is elided, nor less, as:

lomna γει-αι, meat οφ mmne:
[i.e.‚ Good the tales told of Μαι-γ l]

Except‚† however, in the kind of mette called remo. in the
ξιέᾓίτὶέιέῗ gsf, each semi-mette of which eight syllables are

' meing teucer An lmr ceoctvonn!
[Sad we gaze on Inniskillen l]

1 have said except when a syllable is elided or merged by ’
the figure called uacuo (merging or sinking), for whenever
two s llables should be pronounced as one, in order that
this e 'sion may arise, it is necessary that one word should
end in a vowel [called the comapomg ?]. There should also
occur an nanmoeunta or adverb beginning with a vowel and
immediately following the aforesaid word, so that the final
vowel of the one and the initial oi the other meet and form
one single syllable, usually short ; aS,

Anam ne noge Δ ‘sti mamit—
[Wait for the chosen one, Ο great King l]

-where the Δ of noga is elided by the subsequent particle Δ.

zThis word corner shows that the original and fundamental dis-
tinction between metres in Irish was the measure of the line, that ie,
the number of syllables in it. Indeed the word (formed from oo-ro-
merr) is a compound of ‘merr now meur, and contains the same root
as μέγ-ρον and the Latin met-or, met-ior, mens-ura, whence ¹‘ measure.”

Other circumstances besides the number of syllables, no doubt, in later
times gave rise to varieties of the same metre.

†The author overlooks the five-syllabled mette called venenuo θεας
and the six-syllabled monna υ in which the pettme Aongura was
written. There were also our-syllabled and even three-syllabled
metrebwhilst on the other hand, oputgneuc admitted any number
οἱ syllables from nine to thirteen. But in veihane, cuj-namn and
the two species of pannungeaet, the seven-syllabled line was the rule.

ssThe word 1 have read ήιᾶηκ is doubtful. 11: may have been meant
for τὴληψ (Δ 1¹⁴ rhAm , Ο king of Matr 1). It seems misprinted in the
Roman edition, whic has ‘⁶ umhmmw

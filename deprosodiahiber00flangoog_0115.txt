CHAPTER XII.
Os Popular Poetry and of C omposition.

1. By popular poetry Ι mean the verse used by the common
people-—ch1efly of two kinds—known to the Irish as 1) the
nonan* or song, called also eunoun or centumve, and 2) the
caome or elegy—called also cumea-o.

2. Now the (stanza of the) aowin or song consists of four
lines alike in every respect as to amur and other rimeS, so
that no line exceeds the other, and in none is there a repetition
of the same word--I say nothing of articles and other un-

of whlch w111 be of one or two syllables—m a semple verse,
at least, not in the double—and this foot will rime only with
the first feet of the subse uent lineS. The second and third
feet will rime with each o er, and will consist of two syllables
at least. The fourth foot will contain at least two syllables,
and will not rime except with the fourth feet of the three
sullise) uent lines The fifth foot will usually be of one
sy a e.

* The older and more correct form is Δήηώη, which may be from
Λήηω (or Λτὴῑωὲ) which sometimes means a panegyric, sometimes an
elegy. In form it is a diminutive, like the Latin cant-iamne, cantio
(whence French chanson), cantilena, etc„ bennun is a late Norman word
from Fr. bourdon, whence also Eng. burthen, burdon: it is still used
in Munster for a song. ceatmfn, ceat‘mm'na (or ceaepmffle) is used in
three different senses: (1) the fourth part, i.e., a line or uartan of a
four-lined stanza z this is the very oldest sense (as appli to poetry)
and it is used by our author in this sense: see Chaps Ι. and 1.; (2)
the fourth part of a four-stanza song, hence any stanza or “ verse ”
of a song ; (3) a short song, any song, as used here by Fr. ὁ Molloy.
This last sense is rare. cumea-o is more correctly spelt eamearn
(see Seuer: SimoAnca Saeossffie).

τ Notice this is the first time that the author speaks of feel (“ pedes '’)
in treating of Irish poetry—-in all the previous chapters he has spoken
of syllables only as constituting the εόήιᾼγ οι· metre. Observe, too,
that the author unreservedly oi teet ot one syllable. However
shy modern echo s may be in admitting such in classical Greek or
Latin verse there is no doubt whatever that we have monosyllabic
feet in modern Irish verse.

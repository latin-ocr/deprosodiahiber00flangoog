9. Note, however, that m is rarel long* at the end of a word,
as in camd· mam ; rarely, indee , is this pronounced long,
because the strong consonantS, especially finaIS, are of medium
length in pronunciation—-I say medium, that is, as ex lained
above, between long and short. Recall to mind w at we
said above about the quqntp'ty of a syllable commonly called
meme ξ mamm
a long line is laced over oar, por, etc„ without wluch the
· vowels would short, as, oar, por, bor, over which no line
is placed. The medium quantity, however, denoted by a
superimposed line, not so long as in the former case, is expressed
by a certain medium length of pronunciation—-not so much
long or short—but short rather than long, and long rather
than short, as in came, seut, noun, reAnS-of which enough
for the present—the subject will recur.

¹⁸¹ The author means not so much the letter m itself, or even its sound,
as a syllable ending in m, es ecially a monosyllable, as mam, am, tom,
tom, 7c. Vowels and syllaffies are said to have quantity, and to be
long or short, but length is not generally ascribed to consonant&

iteam is probably the word now pronounced and written 4m=time,
occasion. sse c is robably mdical, cf. cam-atta little time, a
while. The t drop out under the influence of the article—an tam
was thought to be En an πψτη. Cf. Latin urbs, orbis for turbs {orbis :
cf. also Ir. uniam for nuw'nm, ‘²1¹ an novur for 1⁰:41¹ an ooflurztav an
oovur=through the doorway.

cam is robably the same as the Welsh tam, tamaid=a small piece,
a bit. he root is found also in Lat. tem-pm, tem-plum, and is no
doubt identical with the rep—in φίμνωεῐ cut.

ΣΟ Molloy and some other writers after him confounded the
Irish ‘pinea-o, rine, a stretchin , extending, lengthening, with the
horrowed word rine older ragne {or Ο. Ir. ysne, 220„ the Latin signum,
ζιέἰέἲ ἓξ ἓῗωξξοὲἶὲ““ gffzffigsszzzsfflssssffloffssffiss &2333
it is but the sign of the long uantlty ς butt. he lls it correetly ragno
m subsequent chapters. e confounding o the two words was
natural.
